[`react-google-maps`][react-google-maps] provides a set of React components wrapping the underlying [Google Maps JavaScript API v3][gmjsav3] instances. The wrapping simply do:

* **props delegation** 
* **events as callbacks**
* **lifecycle management**
* **auto-mount on map**

That's it. _Nothing more_. If you find some limitations, that might be due to [Google Maps JavaScript API v3][gmjsav3] but not [`react-google-maps`][react-google-maps].

This documentation site is created with the awesome [react-styleguidist][react-styleguidist]. It comes with components documentation with props, public methods and **live demo**. The live demos come with **live updates** by clicking the `CODE` button on the bottom-left corner and editing there.
